Global energy consumption grew significantly in last decade, spurred by the sustained economic growth and rising demand in the United States which is one of the worldâ€™s largest energy consumers. Total energy consumption in the United States reached a record high of 2.3 Gtoe (Gigatonne of Oil Equivalent) in 2018, up 3.5% from 2017.
If we put no cap on this alarming environmental problem we need to be prepared for the repercussions, but if can use our expertise in predicting the trends for next 5 years then we can start act on it to control this harmful climate impacts.
For this very reason we are interested in forecasting the future trend for energy consumption in the United States. We are concentrating our analysis on the following 3 categories,
o Total Primary Energy Consumption
o Total Renewable Energy Consumption
o Total Fossil Fuels Consumption
